If you like what I have done here and want to help I would recommend that you firstly look into supporting Homebridge. None of this could happen without them.

After you have done that if you feel like my work has been valuable to you I welcome your support through Paypal. All funding goes back into product purchases. I would love to support all products that Wyze has under their portfolio along with other product that gets rebranded for other companies.
